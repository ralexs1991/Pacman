# Pacman
This creates an animated Pacman from the classic Namco game. Pacman will then travel back and forth across the screen turning around when he hit the edge of the screen.

# To Run 

1. To run this program simply download the repository
2. Save it to your desktop
3. Open pacman.js and index.html to your browser
4. Enjoy!

# Roadmap of future improvements

I would like to eventually make a complete pacman game with the ghosts and power pellets
